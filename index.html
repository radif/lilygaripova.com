                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Lily helped us buy our first home, and we had an amazing experience working with her! She is incredibly knowledgeable about the area, the houses, and any potential issues they might have. She has a great eye for spotting anything that could become a problem. Before choosing Lily, we met with a few other agents, but we immediately trusted her from the very first meeting. She answered every question in depth and with such confidence that it was clear how experienced she is. We visited multiple houses together, and she was available for showings in the evenings and on weekends. You often hear about agents who push for a sale just to earn a commission, but Lily was the complete opposite - she would actually talk us out of buying a house after finding issues in the paperwork and inspections. She was genuinely invested in helping us find the perfect home for our family, and it truly felt like working with a family member who was always on our side. We recommend Lily to all our friends!"</p>

What seemed daunting became a smooth, exciting adventure thanks to her profound impact. We highly recommend her. Lily quickly grasped our needs, building immediate trust. Her deep market knowledge, covering neighborhood dynamics and property values, ensured wise investment decisions. During viewings, Lily's expertise shone. Her incredible eye for detail, prioritizing our satisfaction, made us feel reassured. Finding our dream home, Lily's negotiation mastery was evident. She strategically advocated for us, securing excellent terms. We fully trusted her tireless protection of our interests. Communication was outstanding. Lily was always accessible, promptly responding and providing clear updates, fostering calm and turning challenges into manageable inconveniences. Beyond competence, Lily's genuine care made us feel like valued partners. Her enthusiasm and unwavering support, even post-closing, solidified our view: she's remarkable and deeply cares for clients."</p>

Lily was truly amazing—she guided us through every step with passion, knowledge, and genuine care. As first-time homebuyers, we had so many questions, but she was always patient and thorough, providing valuable insights that helped us make confident decisions. She showed us multiple homes and never rushed the process. Her deep expertise and understanding of the local market were evident in how she pointed out things we never would have noticed ourselves. We felt supported, informed, and empowered throughout. She made what could've been a stressful journey feel smooth and even exciting. We're beyond grateful for her dedication and couldn't have asked for a better person to help us find our new home. Highly recommend!"</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Lily helped us to purchase our first house and we are extremely happy with the process and the results. We've reached out to Lily early January 2023 and our goal was to buy our new place before our lease ends in April. Lily went above and beyond helping us and we had one of our offers accepted at the end of January already! We were first time home buyers and during our initial meeting she walked us through the process, explained all necessary steps and answered all our questions. She was able to schedule house visits for us on very short notice. Basically every morning we planned which houses we are going to see in the afternoon. We worked in this pace for 3 weeks and visited about 20 houses total. While she provided her opinion about places we visited we never felt like we are being pushed into decisions. It was always our decision when we made offers, but Lily greatly helped in deciding when it's better to do it and under which conditions."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Lily helped us to purchase our first home in the SF Bay area. Lily guided us for almost 2 years, through some challenging times for buyers, while educating us on the SF Bay real-estate market. My wife and I are not from the bay area, so we had opinions about property and the buying process that did not apply to this region; Lily guided us on each bid, and educated us on why we lost these bids, until finally we were able to place a winning bid on an excellent home. Lily communicated with us very well, and fought for us to make sure that the process was as smooth as possible. She would read the disclosure for each home we bid on, and provided her opinion on which items we needed to consider for the bid. Her ability to estimate the appraised value of a home was spot on. We highly recommend working with Lily and we will rely on her for any future transactions."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Lily is a true expert on the real estate matter. We were first-time home buyers with zero knowledge of what steps we needed to take. So we appreciate Lily's professionalism and patience. We asked many questions, and Lily's help was invaluable. Thanks to her help and support, we closed the deal without hassles and learned much about house-buying procedures. We highly recommend Lily to everybody who is looking for a new home, especially first-time home buyers."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"We just sold our house in San Jose. Our agent Lily Zaripova helped us a lot. She explained to us many important things which made selling process much easier. The real estate situation at the time we decided to sell was not ordinary but Lily guided us with her great knowledge and we get an offer above our expectations. We will recommend Lily to our friends."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Great realtor to work with, has a lot of knowledge of the bay area market with some in-depth market insights. I used to be a buyer during tough times of the extremely bullish market and we were able to negotiate a better price and a couple of costly appliances during closing. Very responsive at all stages of the buying journey. Very professional and knowledgeable of all potential outcomes of the deal ultimately optimizing clients time to put an offer or not."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"We have bought and sold the house with Lily. We had smooth transactions both times. When we bought the house a few years ago we negotiated the price down, so we got under-market numbers. When we sold the house this year, we got the maximum possible numbers, even better than we expected and higher than market estimates. She handled everything professionally and fast and helped us with documents, inspections, and negotiations. I can highly recommend Lily to anyone!"</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Lily is the best! She was professional and personal. She was always available to show us houses any time we asked for. We changed our directions and search areas so many times, but she stayed patient and helped us navigate the market. It was our first experience with buying a house. Of course, we had a lot of questions. She always was there for us, explaining everything in a way that was easy to understand, from making the offer to working with the mortgage broker and to sewerage repairs. She provided a WOW service, and we will recommend her to all our friends."</p>
